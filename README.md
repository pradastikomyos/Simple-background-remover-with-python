# Simple Image Background Remover

This project provides a simple Python script to remove the background from images using the `rembg` library. It’s designed to be beginner-friendly and can be easily run on Google Colab, making it accessible without needing a powerful local setup.

## Features
- Removes backgrounds from images with a single script.
- Works with common image formats (e.g., PNG, JPG).
- Runs seamlessly on Google Colab for free cloud-based processing.

## Prerequisites
To use this project, you’ll need:
- A Google account (to access Google Colab).
- Basic familiarity with Python (though the script is straightforward!).

No local installation is required if you use Colab, as everything runs in the cloud.
